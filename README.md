# Movie-Recommendator

A recommendation system is a system that can predict a user's future preferences for a set of goods and recommend the top-ranked goods. One of the key reasons why we need recommendation systems in modern society is that people have so many choices due to the popularity of the Internet. 
In the past, people were used to shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, where the number of items available was limited. 
In contrast, today, the Internet allows people to access a wealth of resources online. While the amount of available information has increased, a new problem has emerged because it is difficult for people to choose the items they really want to watch. This is where recommendation systems come in handy.

In this project, a baseline movie recommendation system is built by using TMDB movie metadataand and it can serve as the foundation for a recommendation system and give something to start with.
